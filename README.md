# 🧠 Data Analyst Portfolio Project: Linear Regression with ETL in Python

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio project! This repository demonstrates how to apply **linear regression** to a real-world dataset using Python, along with a basic **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline — all in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Practice and showcase core data analysis skills
- Build a simple machine learning model (linear regression)
- Apply ETL principles to clean and prepare data
- Visualize data and interpret model results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🔄 ETL Pipeline

The notebook includes a basic ETL process:
- **Extract**: Load data from a CSV file
- **Transform**: Clean, filter, and preprocess the data
- **Load**: Save the cleaned data for further analysis

## 📈 Machine Learning Task

We use **linear regression** to predict a numeric target variable from one or more input features. The modeling process includes:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training using `scikit-learn`
- Model evaluation (R², RMSE)
- Coefficient interpretation

## 📊 Example Outputs

- Correlation heatmaps
- Residual plots
- Performance metrics for model evaluation
- Interpretation of coefficients
